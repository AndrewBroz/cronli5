# Feature backlog

Designed-but-parked features — captured so the thinking isn't lost, but not
actively pursued. Current development is **automated-only** (see
[i18n-design.md](./i18n-design.md) and CONTRIBUTING.md for the active path).

## Human-in-the-loop language review platform

**Status:** Parked — it has long feedback loops (real fluent reviewers,
async). The automated path (a cross-family model as judge + baseline, with
languages shipping as **beta**) is being pursued first; this platform is how
a beta language graduates to **stable**.

**Problem.** A fluent-but-non-technical reviewer must author/approve a
language module's golden corpus — the naturalness/correctness oracle that
*cannot* be auto-generated — and their judgments must return to the repo as
committed changes.

**The bar (what "best" means here).** A git-backed review-to-PR loop, not a
static file:

- The reviewer opens a link, works a queue, and never touches git/npm/JS.
- Each item shows a **language-neutral gloss** of the schedule (24-hour
  numerals + own-language day/month names) plus 2–3 **candidate renderings**
  side by side (cronli5, the cRonstrue locale, the LLM-natural baseline).
- Actions: **approve · rewrite-in-my-words · flag · comment.**
- State: per-item (pending / approved / disputed / settled), per-language
  progress, multiple reviewers, and **adjudication** of disagreements.
- The loop **closes**: settled items → a PR updating `corpus.js` +
  `status.json` (with reviewer attribution) → renderer adjusted until corpus
  tests pass → status table regenerated.

**Definition of done.**
- *Per item:* an approved rendering, ≥1 (≥2 for stable) fluent reviewers
  agree, no open flag.
- *Per module:* the spanning set is 100% settled (every `PlanNode` kind ×
  grammatical feature has an approved item), the renderer reproduces every
  settled item, a cross-family review passed, and the gates are green.
  Versioned — new cron features or a re-review reopen it.

**Build vs. adopt: adopt.** This is a solved category; a bespoke review app
would repeat the "generalize from one example" mistake. Prior art:
- **Localization platforms** (Weblate, Pontoon, Crowdin, Tolgee) — native
  git-PR write-back + non-technical UI. They win the commit loop.
- **Data-annotation** (Label Studio, Argilla) — multi-candidate review and
  correction. They win the side-by-side view.
- **LLM-eval annotation** (Argilla, LangSmith, Braintrust) — overlaps the
  baseline comparison directly.

The framing that makes a TMS fit: the corpus is a **parallel corpus**
(English rendering = source string, target prose = "translation"), so
reviewing it *is* reviewing translation output. Recommended pilot: **Weblate
with German**, feeding cronli5/cRonstrue/LLM renderings in as suggestions.

**Generalizes to** any system that generates outputs it can't self-validate,
where the oracle is human judgment that must return as committed reference
data — NLG/report generators, accessibility alt-text, voice-assistant
phrasings, LLM eval-set curation, style/tone compliance.

**The seam (NOT parked).** `corpus.js` + `status.json` + an import/export
adapter is the contract between cronli5 and any review tool. The automated
path needs it too, so it gets locked now; the human UI plugs into it later.
